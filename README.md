# Basic-Image-Processing
Implementing some functions for manipulating images. Will use the PPM (portable pix map) format, as it is one of the easiest to understand and process. PPM is often used as an intermediary format, i.e. the lowest common denominator color image format, that nearly all other formats (e.g. jpg, gif, png) can be translated to and from.
